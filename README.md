# Data Project Practice Files

This project is a practice file for data science, mainly including data collection, data visualization, and modeling.

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Directory to store datasets.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and modeling.
- **scripts/**: Python scripts for data processing and modeling.
- **reports/**: Directory to store generated reports and visualizations.

## Project Contents

### Data Collection

In this project, we will collect data from various sources, including CSV files, databases, and API interfaces.

### Data Visualization

Data visualization is a crucial part of data analysis. In this section, we will use tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize the data to better understand its characteristics and distributions.

### Modeling

The modeling section will cover the entire process from data preprocessing to model evaluation. We will use machine learning libraries such as Scikit-Learn to build and evaluate models to solve specific business problems.

## Installation

To run this project, please ensure you have installed the following dependencies:
